      <p class="text-justify">This is a hobby project to monitor the system resources of a Linux machine. The project consists of
      two parts: the agent and the UI. The agent is a rust application that collects the system resources
      data. The UI is a Vue.js application that displays the data in a user-friendly way.
      The agent is installed on the Linux machine that you want to monitor. The UI is a web application
      that you can access from any device with a web browser. The agent exposes the data through a
      rest api. >The project is open source and you can find the code on GitHub. Feel free to use it,
      modify it, and contribute to it. If you have any questions or suggestions, please let me know.
      Thank you for checking out my project!</p>
